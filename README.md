# Introduction

This is my nvim config. I don't know how to nvim, copy at your own risk.


# Instructions

Git clone this repo so that it sits at `~/.config/nvim`,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atropos112/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
this should work on any linux distro, and on Mac, I suspect also on WSL but I have not tried.

Once you have done this you will also need to install neovim, figure this out yourself its very OS dependent. Having this it should hopefully just work, I am low-key worried I have created un-intentional dependency on rust/go but heyho.
